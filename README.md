## **wednesday addams**
Addams Family members were unnamed in The New Yorker cartoons that first appeared in 1938. When the characters were adapted for the 1964 television series, Charles Addams named Wednesday based on the nursery rhyme line: "Wednesday's child is full of woe". Actress and poet Joan Blake, an acquaintance of Charles Addams, offered the idea for the name. Wednesday is the sister of Pugsley Addams, the only daughter of Gomez and Morticia Addams. Earlier adaptations depict her as the younger sibling, while later adaptations depict Wednesday as the elder Addams child.
